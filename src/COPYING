  This is the Info-ZIP file COPYING (for UnZip), last updated 22 May 97.
__________________________________________________________________________

   There are currently five explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip
   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):  the original Sam Smith
   copyright on unzip 2.0, upon which Info-ZIP's UnZip 3.0 was based;
   Igor Mandrichenko's copyright on his routines in vms.c; Greg Roelofs'
   copyright on zipinfo.c and the new version of unshrink.c; Mike White's
   copyright on the Windows DLL code (windll/*); and Steve P. Miller's
   copyright on the Pocket UnZip GUI (wince/*).  In addition, Mark Adler
   has placed inflate.h, inflate.c, explode.c and funzip.c into the public
   domain; i.e., these files may be used without any restrictions beyond
   those of simple courtesy (credit where it's due).  All of these are
   discussed immediately below; the remaining code is covered by an im-
   plicit copyright under US law.  Frequently Asked Questions regarding
   (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip are near the end of this file.

   There are no known patents on any of the code in UnZip.  Unisys
   claims a patent on LZW encoding and on LZW decoding _in an apparatus
   that performs LZW encoding_, but the patent appears to exempt a lone
   decoder (as in UnZip's unshrink.c).  Unisys has publicly claimed
   otherwise, but the issue has never been tested in court.  Since this
   point is unclear, unshrinking is not enabled by default.  It is the
   responsibility of the user to make his or her peace with Unisys and
   its licensing requirements.  (unshrink.c may be removed from future
   releases altogether.)
__________________________________________________________________________

   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and
   almost entirely rewritten (changes include random zipfile access
   rather than sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode();
   replacement of old unshrink() with new (unrelated) unshrink(); re-
   placement of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards,
   filename-mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can
   tell, the only remaining code that is substantially similar to
   Mr. Smith's is that in the file unreduce.c, which now by default
   is NOT compiled.  The following copyright applies to unreduce.c:

     * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved
     *
     * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.
     * Do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice.
     * If you use this in your own program you must distribute source code.
     * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.

   Regarding the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was tracked down in southern
   California some years back [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop; as of mid-
   May 1994, (213) 851-9969 (voice), (213) 887-2127(?) (subscription BBS),
   71150.2731@compuserve.com]:

   "He says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that
    he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of his code.
    His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said."

   Despite the fact that our "normal" code has been entirely rewritten
   and by default no longer contains any of Mr. Smith's code, Info-ZIP
   remains indebted and grateful to him.  We hope he finds our contribu-
   tions as useful as we have his.

   Note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com-
   pany that wishes to incorporate the unreduce code into its products;
   if you wish to do so, you must contact Mr. Smith directly regarding
   licensing.


   The following copyright applies to most of the VMS code in vms.c,
   distributed with UnZip versions 4.2 and later:

     * Copyright (c) 1992 Igor Mandrichenko.
     * Permission is granted to any individual or institution to use,
     * copy, or redistribute this software so long as all of the orig-
     * inal files are included unmodified, that it is not sold for
     * profit, and that this copyright notice is retained.


   The following copyright applies to the new version of unshrink.c,
   distributed with UnZip versions 5.2 and later:

     * Copyright (c) 1994 Greg Roelofs.
     * Permission is granted to any individual/institution/corporate
     * entity to use, copy, redistribute or modify this software for
     * any purpose whatsoever, subject to the conditions noted in the
     * Frequently Asked Questions section below, plus one additional
     * condition:  namely, that my name not be removed from the source
     * code.  (Other names may, of course, be added as modifications
     * are made.)  Corporate legal staff (like at IBM :-) ) who have
     * problems understanding this can contact me through Zip-Bugs...


   The following copyright applies to the Windows DLL code (windll/*),
   distributed with UnZip versions 5.2 and later:

     * Copyright (c) 1996 Mike White.
     * Permission is granted to any individual or institution to use,
     * copy, or redistribute this software so long as all of the original
     * files are included, that it is not sold for profit, and that this
     * copyright notice is retained.


   The following copyright applies to the Windows CE GUI port, ``Pocket
   UnZip,'' distributed with UnZip versions 5.3 and later:

     * All the source files for Pocket UnZip, except for components
     * written by the Info-ZIP group, are copyrighted 1997 by Steve P.
     * Miller.  The product "Pocket UnZip" itself is property of the
     * author and cannot be altered in any way without written consent
     * from Steve P. Miller.


   The remaining code was written by many people associated with the
   Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):
   Greg Roelofs (overall program logic, ZipInfo, unshrink, filename
   mapping/portability, etc.), Mark Adler (inflate, explode, funzip),
   Kai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), Antoine
   Verheijen (Macintosh), Hunter Goatley (more VMS), Mike White (Windows
   DLLs), Christian Spieler (overall logic, optimization, etc.) and
   others.  See the file CONTRIBS in the source distribution for a much
   more complete list of contributors.  As noted above, Mark Adler's
   inflate.[ch], explode.c and funzip.c are in the public domain, and
   everything that isn't otherwise accounted for is implicitly copy-
   righted by Info-ZIP.  In other words, use it with our blessings, but
   it's still our code.  Thank you!

   Frequently Asked Questions about distributing Zip and UnZip:


   Q. Can I distribute Zip and UnZip sources and/or executables?

   A. You may redistribute the latest official distributions without
      any modification, and without even asking us for permission.
      (Note that an "executable distribution" includes documentation,
      even if it's in a separate zipfile; plain executables do NOT
      count.)  You can charge for the cost of the media (CDROM, disk-
      ettes, etc.), the compilation (e.g., of a software archive),
      and a small copying fee.  Distributed archives should follow
      the naming conventions used in the `Where' file.  If you want
      to distribute modified versions, please contact us at
      Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu first.  You must not distribute beta
      versions without explicit permission to do so.


   Q. Can I use the executables (or DLLs) of Zip and UnZip to distribute
      my software?

   A. Yes, so long as it is clear that Zip and UnZip are not being
      sold, that the source code is freely available, and that there
      are no extra or hidden charges resulting from its use by or in-
      clusion with the commercial product.  Here is an example of a
      suitable notice:

         NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's
         compression utility.  The installation program uses UnZip
         to read zip files from the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip,
         UnZip and related utilities) is free and can be obtained
         as source code or executables from various bulletin board
         services and Internet/WWW sites, including CompuServe's
         IBMPRO forum and ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ .

      If the distribution is being done with UnZipSFX instead of a DLL
      or stand-alone copy of UnZip (i.e., as one or more self-extracting
      archives), no notice is required as long as the normal UnZipSFX
      banner has not been removed.


   Q. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial
      application?

   A. Yes, so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment
      and an offer of the original compression sources for free or for
      a small copying fee, and make clear that there are no extra or
      hidden charges resulting from the use of the compression code by
      your product (see below for an example).  The acknowledgment should
      appear in at least one piece of human-readable documentation (e.g.,
      a README file or man page), although additionally putting it in
      the executable(s) is OK, too.  In other words, you are allowed to
      sell only your own work, not ours, and we'd like a little credit.
      (Note the additional restrictions above on the code in unreduce.c,
      unshrink.c and vms.c.)  Contact us at zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu if
      you have special requirements.  We also like to know when our code
      is being used, but we don't require that.

         <Product> incorporates compression code by the Info-ZIP group.
         There are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code,
         and the original compression sources are freely available from
         ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ on the Internet.  We will also,
         upon request, mail you the full sources on a 3.5" MSDOS-format
         diskette for the cost of mailing.  Send $2 to <address> and ...

      If you only need compression capability, not full zipfile support,
      you might want to look at zlib instead; it has fewer restrictions
      on commercial use.  See http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ .
